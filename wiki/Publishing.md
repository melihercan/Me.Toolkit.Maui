# Publishing

Packaging is done by GitHub Actions, in `.github/workflows/`.

- **`ci.yml`** — build and test on every push and PR to master. Builds with `-warnaserror`, so the
  repository's zero-warning bar is enforced there, and a new NuGet advisory fails the build.
- **`publish.yml`** — **one workflow for every package, deliberately.**

## One workflow, on purpose

A NuGet Trusted Publishing policy is bound to a **single workflow file** and a **single repository**,
so one file means one policy covers every package, every future version, and any future `Me.Toolkit.Maui.X`
package. **Do not split publishing into per-package workflow files** — that would require a policy
per file.

## Ways in

| Trigger | Publishes |
|---|---|
| tag `v<version>` | every package |
| tag `configuration-v<version>` | `Me.Toolkit.Maui.Configuration` only |
| tag `hosting-v<version>` | `Me.Toolkit.Maui.Hosting` only |
| tag `sizing-v<version>` | `Me.Toolkit.Maui.Sizing` only |
| tag `webhostpatch-v<version>` | `Me.Toolkit.Maui.WebHostPatch` only |
| manual run | defaults to a **dry run** that packs and uploads the `.nupkg` files as artifacts without publishing |

The workflow takes the version from the tag, builds and tests with it, and packs with `--no-build`,
so what is published is exactly what the tests ran against.

A tag push does **not** pass `--skip-duplicate`. That flag is for deliberately re-running a release
that is already out, and it cannot distinguish that from a refusal — the first attempt to publish
these packages was rejected three times with `409 The package ID is reserved` and reported success,
because that is a 409 like any other. Only a manual run can ask for it.

## `Me.Toolkit.Maui.Sizing` creates a new package ID

It has a trigger and is in the `v<version>` set, but has never been pushed. Its first push creates
the `Me.Toolkit.Maui.Sizing` ID, which only the Trusted Publishing policy's **"Push new packages and
package versions"** scope allows — see [The policy](#the-policy). A `v<version>` tag now publishes
all four packages; tag `sizing-v<version>` to release it alone.

## `Me.Toolkit.Maui.Nfc` is not published

It builds, ships in the demo, and has tests — but its reading session is unfinished and has never
been exercised against a physical tag. The project sets `IsPackable=false`, so a plain
`dotnet pack` on the solution cannot produce a `Me.Toolkit.Maui.Nfc.nupkg` by accident; `publish.yml` has no
`nfc-v*` trigger either. Remove the `IsPackable` line and add the trigger together when it is ready.

It is still **built** by the publish job, because the tests read every library's compiled assemblies
off disk through `MetadataLoadContext`. Skipping its build fails `PublicApiSurfaceTests` and
`MultiTargetingTests`, not just its own tests.

## Why the name is not Mauime

This repository was called Mauime, and the packages were to be `Mauime.*`. They cannot be:

```
409 The package ID is reserved. You can upload your package with a different
package ID. Reach out to support@nuget.org if you have questions.
```

An ID beginning with `Maui` is reserved. No package on nuget.org starts with those four letters —
200 search results and eight targeted probes found none — and every community MAUI package puts the
word second: `CommunityToolkit.Maui`, `Plugin.Maui.Audio`, `Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit`. The clearest
case is `Reactor.Maui`, whose project is *called* MauiReactor.

`Blazor` and `Xamarin` were never reserved this way, which is why `Blazorme.*` and `Xamarinme.*`
publish without trouble. Reservations are granted per request, not automatically for every Microsoft
technology name, and MAUI's was taken when it shipped in 2022.

Only the published ID changes. Consumers install `Me.Toolkit.Maui.Configuration` and write
`using Me.Toolkit.Maui.Configuration;`, which is ordinary for a vendor- or toolkit-prefixed package.

`Toolkit.*` alone was tried next and refused the same way: *"This package ID has been reserved.
Please request access to upload to this reserved namespace from the owner of the reserved prefix."*
That `Toolkit.Data` and `Toolkit.CodeBase` already exist proves nothing — a reservation blocks only
new IDs, which is exactly why `Xamarinme.*` survives while `Mauime.*` does not.

`Me.Toolkit.Maui.*` was accepted, with `201 Created`.

Reservations cannot be queried through any API. The only test is a push, so each candidate prefix
costs a release run, and any ordinary English word is a gamble. Everything — repository, folders,
projects, assemblies, namespaces, types and package IDs — carries the same name, so there is nothing
to keep in step.

`Me.*` is not yet prefix-reserved. Requesting that reservation would give the verified badge and
stop anyone else taking `Me.Something`; it is worth doing now that something is published under it.

## This must run on Windows

`publish.yml` uses `runs-on: windows-latest`, and unlike `ci.yml` this is not merely about coverage —
it decides what ends up **inside the published package**. `Directory.Build.props` builds
`net10.0-ios` and `net10.0-maccatalyst` only off Linux, and `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0` only on
Windows:

| Runner | Slices packed |
|---|---|
| `ubuntu-latest` | 2 of 5 — `net10.0`, `net10.0-android` |
| `macos-latest` | 4 of 5 — no Windows |
| `windows-latest` | **all 5** |

Packing on the wrong runner does not fail. It produces a valid package that silently supports two
platforms instead of five, publishes it with a green tick, and nobody finds out until someone's iOS
app fails to restore it. Since a published version cannot be replaced, that is a permanent mistake.

So the job ends with **“Verify every package carries all five target frameworks”**, which opens each
`.nupkg` and fails the run if any expected slice is missing. The framework names are matched by
prefix, because the platform versions are stamped in — `net10.0-android36.0`,
`net10.0-windows10.0.19041`. Treat that step as the real rule and the `runs-on` line as its
consequence.

## The tag is the version

No project declares a `<Version>`. The tag is the only place a version is written, and the workflow
passes it to both the build and the pack — the build too, because packing uses `--no-build`, and
without it the assemblies would be stamped 1.0.0 inside a package claiming the real version.

Write the tag either way:

```
v26.09.26     or     v26.9.26
```

Both publish **26.9.26**. NuGet strips leading zeros, so the workflow normalises the tag before
building and says so in a notice when it had to; the readable spelling is allowed because a date
reads better with the zeros in. A manual run has no tag and uses today's date in the normalised form
— what a tag cut today would give — rather than the silent 1.0.0 a missing version would produce.

This replaced a check that the tag matched each csproj's raw `<Version>` text. Four csprojs saying
`26.09.09`, a tag that had to say the same, and nuget.org showing `26.9.9` were three spellings of one
fact, and one of them was guaranteed to disagree with what shipped.

## Trusted Publishing, not an API key

nuget.org discourages API keys for automated publishing. The job requests a GitHub OIDC token
(`id-token: write`) and `NuGet/login@v1` exchanges it for an API key valid for one hour. **No
publishing secret is stored in the repository — do not introduce `NUGET_API_KEY`.**

The login step sits immediately before the push on purpose: the key expires, and each OIDC token
buys exactly one key.

### The policy

**This has to exist before the first tag is pushed.** Without it the run does everything correctly
and fails at the final step. Created on nuget.org under Account → Trusted Publishing:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Package Owner | `melihercan` |
| CI/CD Provider | GitHub Actions |
| Repository Owner | `melihercan` |
| Repository | `Me.Toolkit.Maui` |
| Workflow File | `publish.yml` (file name only, no path) |
| Environment | *(none)* |
| Scopes | Push new packages and package versions |
| Glob | `Me.Toolkit.Maui.*` |

**Renaming the GitHub repository breaks the policy.** This repository was renamed from `Mauime`,
and the next publish failed at the login step with

```
Token exchange failed (HTTP 401)
No matching trust policy owned by user 'melihercan' was found.
```

The policy records the repository **name**, captured when it is created, and matches the OIDC token
on that name. A rename leaves it pointing at a name that no longer exists. Nothing warns you: the
policy still shows **Active** with a correct-looking glob and scope, and the failure appears only on
the next publish.

**Editing cannot fix it.** The edit form has no Repository field — only Policy Name, Workflow File,
Environment, Scopes and Glob. The repository is fixed at creation, so the policy must be deleted and
recreated.

**And recreating it with the old name silently reproduces the fault.** GitHub redirects the old name
to the new one, so nuget.org resolves `Mauime` happily, stores `Mauime`, and fails to match a token
claiming `Me.Toolkit.Maui` — the summary line then reads `Repository: Mauime #1361272941`, with the
right repository ID beside the wrong name. That summary line is the only place the problem is
visible; check it after creating the policy.

The failure is at least harmless — the token exchange happens before anything is pushed, so a stale
policy cannot publish something wrong, it just cannot publish at all.

Because `Me.Toolkit.Maui.*` are new IDs with no existing owner, the glob has to permit **new** packages, not
just new versions of existing ones — that is the "Push new packages and package versions" scope
above. A policy limited to new versions works for every release after the first and fails on the
first.

### Validation is not instant

A newly pushed package is accepted with `201 Created` and then goes through nuget.org's validation
pipeline before it becomes downloadable. Until it clears, the version is *taken* — a second push
gets `409 already exists` — but it is absent from the flat container and its package page returns
404 to anyone but the owner.

`26.9.9` took around three hours. Long enough that pending and failed are indistinguishable from
outside, and only the owner's [account page](https://www.nuget.org/account/Packages) shows which. Do
not conclude a push failed because the package is not there yet; check the push step's status line
first, and the account page second.

### Rehearsing without publishing

Run the workflow manually from the Actions tab and leave **Dry run** ticked. It packs, prints the
contents of every `.nupkg`, runs the five-framework check, and uploads the packages as build
artifacts — without ever requesting an OIDC token. That exercises everything except the policy
itself, and is worth doing once before the first real tag.

## Versioning

Date-based — `26.9.26` for the 26th of September 2026 — matching the convention used across these
repositories. The version comes from the tag; update each released package's
`<PackageReleaseNotes>` before tagging.

`AssemblyVersion` and `FileVersion` are left to derive from `Version` rather than being set
separately, so they cannot drift.

Nothing here inherits a version history: these are new package IDs with no consumers, so there is no
lowest-version or downgrade problem to reason about. The `Xamarinme.*` packages stay on nuget.org
exactly as they are and are not deprecated — nothing referencing them will ever resolve a `Me.Toolkit.Maui.*`
package, because NuGet has no redirect between IDs.

## There is no demo deployment

`DemoApp` is a MAUI app, not a web app, so there is no equivalent of a GitHub Pages demo to publish.
It is deliberately excluded from both workflows: it is slow to build and nothing in it ships. Its
value is in being run on a device, which is where the `0.0.0.0` defect in `NetworkAddress` was found
— see the [Modernization Log](Modernization-Log).
