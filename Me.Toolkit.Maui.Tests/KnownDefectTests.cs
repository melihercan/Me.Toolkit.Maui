/// Defects of the Xamarinme code that the port fixed, rewritten in place from the pins that
/// recorded them, so each fix shows up as a diff rather than as silence.
///
/// Prefixes carry the status, as in Legacy.Tests:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>FIXED_</c> — was a defect pin; the comment names the pin it replaced.</item>
/// <item><c>DEFECT_</c> — pinned as broken, waiting to be fixed.</item>
/// <item><c>LIMITATION_</c> — not a bug in this code.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Some of these read source text. That is the same second choice the legacy pins made and for the
/// same reason: a net10.0 test project cannot reference the Android or iOS slices, so their code
/// cannot be loaded, let alone run. Where a fix *is* reachable — anything in the NDEF codec or the
/// platform-neutral slice — it is asserted by running it, in <see cref="NdefTests"/> and
/// <see cref="NfcRegistrationTests"/>.
